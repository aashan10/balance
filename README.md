## BALANCE - A Demo Programming Language

I built this project as a hobby and to learn the inner workings of a compiler such as parser, lexer, syntax tree and so on.
As of now, I don't have any vision on how it is going to go in future, but if anyone else is also learning to build compiler/interpreter/transpilers, you can feel free to contribute.

## Installation
Fairly easy, you need to have node and npm and you are good to go. 
But make sure that you have node version > 18.0

- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Run `npm run repl` to start the Balance REPL to test out the features.
